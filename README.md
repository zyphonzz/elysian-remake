super simple thing i made with cxapi. make sure u check it out if u wanna make ur own exec.

had to move the buttons and stuff around, and added inject and clear buttons. 
ik its awkward positioning but the original elysian also looked quite awkward.

if u feel like this is a virus, i've provided the source as a zip file. the reason its named "ProjectLigmaTrustReal" or sumn, is bc i originally made the project a project ligma remake, but then made it into an elysian remake.

enjoy : )
